# **Find My Wod - Front-End**
# Final Capstone Project.
This is a solo project at the end of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum. It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications to improve and test the achievement of technical and soft skills gained during the program. The technical requirements of this front-end project are:
 
1. The project is a mobile web app
2. Use React for the front-end
3. Routes for each of the screens, so the user can easily go back and forward
4. Use redux to store info used across the app
5. Project deployed and accessible online
 
## **Context of the chosen theme**
A *WOD* (Workout of the Day) is a set of modalities that crossfit coaches use to put you through heavy exercises on any given day. It usually is a set of movements that you should finish at a specific time or in a certain number of rounds. <br>
 
There are a number of specific *WODs*, that are well-acknowledged among the athletes. Example:
 
**Murph**:
For Time
1 mile Run
100 Pull-Ups
200 Push-Ups
300 Air Squats
1 mile Run
All with a Weight Vest (20/14 lb)
 
**Annie**: 50-40-30-20-10 Reps For Time of
Double-Unders and Sit-Ups
 
Athletes usually record their favourites *WODs* and try to beat their best time.
 
This app can help the athletes manage their favourite *WODs*.
